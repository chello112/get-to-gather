          <h4>Music festivals where Glastonbury meets Vicar of Dibley</h4>
          <p>
            As the sun hits the sky and nights get longer, it means music festival season is almost here - and it's not
            just about Pulp, Elton John and Billie Eilish. Away from Glastonbury, Isle of Wight and Reading & Leeds,
            there's a boom in local, more affordable mini festivals or, as some call them, "glorified village fetes".
            "They're festivals where Glastonbury meets Vicar of Dibley," said one man who helps run one of the 800 mini
            festivals across the UK. "And people love it." So what is behind the rise?

          <h4>Nottingham's Splendour festival could be forced to relocate</h4>
          <p>
            Organisers of a music festival in Nottingham have been told they will need to bid to continue holding the
            event at the same location. Splendour has taken place at Wollaton Park 13 times over the last 15 years with
            acts like Craig David, Kaiser Chiefs and UB40 performing. The city council said the festival now fell into a
            category where commercial tender was needed.

          <h4>Basildon: Woman suffered cardiac arrest after music festival</h4>
          <p>
            A woman who died after attending a music festival suffered a "prolonged" cardiac arrest, a coroner has
            heard. Samantha Broad, 27, was at the New World Festival in Gloucester Park, Basildon, Essex, on 30 April. A
            coroner was told she was admitted to Basildon University Hospital the following day. Results of a
            post-mortem examination have been delayed by toxicology and histology tests. The inquest at Essex coroner's
            court was adjourned.

          <h4>Midnight Sun music festival is scrapped after poor ticket sales</h4>
          <p>
            A new music festival due to be headlined by Primal Scream on the Isle of Lewis has been cancelled one week
            before its opening night. Not enough tickets were sold for Midnight Sun Weekender, which was due to take
            place from 25 to 27 May at Lew's Castle in Stornoway. The headline acts also included The Pretenders and
            John Fogerty. Organisers said rising costs and a lack of festival infrastructure had also influenced the
            decision to cancel.

          <h4>Whittington Music Festival goes ahead thanks to fundraisers</h4>
          <p>
            In January, the future of Whittington Music Festival was uncertain, after its bid for Â£15,000 from the Arts
            Council was rejected. Following an appeal, about 80 people offered handouts and the performers agreed a
            reduced fee to keep it running. The event starts on Wednesday at Whittington Church and runs until Sunday.
            Ticket sales only account for a third of the cost of running the festival, which started in 2011, and
            organisers say funding for the event is reliant on grants and donations. Roderick Williams OBE, who sang at
            the coronation of King Charles III, is among the headliners set to perform.
